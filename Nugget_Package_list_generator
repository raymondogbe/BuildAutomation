This task was to use jenkins job to list all the packages and save them as artefacts in workspace
The job was parameterized using the string parameter in order to allow me input the specific git repo

Under the source code management, git was checked because git is our VCS (version control software). I called the repository url and use the neccessary credentials
The branch to build was master, since the repo was under master

Batch command in jenkins to call the python script:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install github3.py
pip install pyGithub
pip install lxml

python Nuget_pkglist.py jenkins %jenkins_git_token% %Github_Org_Name%
